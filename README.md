# Bionic Reading - Text Transformer

This is a very simple, yet very important project for me. It's idea came from my girlfriend, who has ADHD and had great difficulty in reading texts in its original shape, so she discovered this thing called Bionic Reading, where the first few letters of each word are transformed in bold letters. As this was a game changer for her studies and she could not find an application to do this in the way she wanted, I decided to develop this application to help her and any other person who struggles the same way.
